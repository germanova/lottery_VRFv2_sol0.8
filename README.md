1. Users can enter lottery with ETH based on USD fee
2. An admin will choose when the lottery is over
3. The lottery will select a random winner

1. `mainnet-fork`
2. `development` with mocks
3. `testnet`

Considerations
1. Subscription creation/delete and LINK funding/withdraw are programmatic so that we can use mocks
